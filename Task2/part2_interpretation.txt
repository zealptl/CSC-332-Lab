Execution output: 

a: 10, b: 30, process_id: 8880
a: 35, b: 25, process_id: 8881
a: 35, b: 45, process_id: 8881                                                                                                                                    
a: 905, b: 25, process_id: 8882

The flow of the program went something like this.
First the parent process P was in execution with the values of a = 10 and b = 25.
When fq=fork() was called a child process Q was forked, but since there are no exec() in the code 
the memory of the process' memory is never replaced and the execution of the parent P continued.
It performed b=a+b-5 which resulted in b=30 and a=10 stayed as it is.
Now child Q is executing and it first executed a=a+b which resulted in a=35 and b=25 stayed the same.
Then Q forked a child R of its own.
Since there are no waits again the execution continued to if(fr != 0) which is true and it executed b=b+20 which resulted b=45 and a=35.
Now child R is executing and it finally executed a=(a*b)+30 which resulted in a=905 and b=25


I executed the program multiple times and I never got an alternate order of the output. 
However, there were sometimes when the execution wasn't waiting properly and never stoping execution.
I think this is because we are not using wait() in our code, so the parent never waits for children to finish and the children processes never exit properly.
